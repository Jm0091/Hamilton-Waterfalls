# Hamilton-Waterfalls

Waterfalls in Hamilton - Exploring Nature with **Google Maps API, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap**.

Hamilton, often referred to as the 'City of Waterfalls,' is home to over 100 stunning waterfalls, offering a serene natural retreat. Inspired by the city's unique landscapes, I developed a web application utilizing Google Maps API, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and CSS to showcase these natural wonders.

Key Features:
Interactive Maps:

Waterfall Details: Displays information about each waterfall, offering users a closer look at the site's features.
Route Finder: Allows users to input their starting location and destination to generate the best route to the selected waterfall.
Travel Mode Options: Users can choose from three travel modes—driving, two-wheeler, or walking—catering to different preferences, whether it's a family strolling with children or individuals planning a scenic drive or bike ride.

The project offered valuable experience with Google Maps API and geolocation services, teaching me the power of integrating location-based features to create engaging, user-friendly applications. The use of Bootstrap also enabled me to craft a responsive and aesthetically pleasing layout, enhancing the overall user experience.
