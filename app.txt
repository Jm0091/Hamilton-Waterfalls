Waterfalls in Hamilton

Hamilton is the city of waterfalls with having more than 100 waterfalls. It is a great benefit to having a wonderful natural place in a neighborhood. It is the best source for human's internal development. Parents have the best opportunity to get children to a natural place to develop their mind power with an absolute positive attitude in life and to teach some life lessons. Adults can go out with friend groups to any waterfall location for a one-day trip. Middle-aged group people can also have a tremendous amount of help from spending little time at waterfall/nature. It helps to reduce stress and generates positive energy and confidence. Therefore, I selected to build a website that contains natural places near the area and Hamilton is 'city of Waterfalls' which gave me the idea to use the existing natural source.

I used a bootstrap theme for the layout of the website. I added two maps: 1. provides details of the particular waterfall. And, 2. ask for the user's starting destination and destination of fall to provide the best route. As an additional feature, I added 'Travelling mode' for the user in three options of driving, two-wheeler, and walking. I selected that feature because citizens in the area with children might want to walk nearer the waterfall. And, other types of people can use a two-wheeler or drive by car for hanging out. 'Maps and Geolocation' taught me a lot after the Google Maps API and it was my great experience to work for this assignment 01.
